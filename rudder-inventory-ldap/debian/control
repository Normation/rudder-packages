Description: Configuration management and audit tool - OpenLDAP
 Rudder is an open source configuration management and audit solution.
 .
 OpenLDAP Software is an open source implementation of the Lightweight Directory
 Access Protocol. See http://www.openldap.org/ for more details.
 .
 This package bundles a version of the OpenLDAP directory software to simplify
 installing Rudder. It is required by the rudder-webapp and
 rudder-inventory-endpoint packages. The LDAP directory is used as storage for
 inventory information collected from the managed nodes (that have the
 rudder-agent package installed) and for configuration rules and parameters.
