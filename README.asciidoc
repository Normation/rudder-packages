=== Synopsis

This git repository contains all the packaging and patches required to build
Rudder packages, in debian and RPM format.

Currently, rudder-agent has been tested and built on Debian 5-6, CentOS 5-6,
RHEL 5-6, Ubuntu 10.04-11.04, SLES 10-11. Other packages are necessary on the
Rudder root server only, and have only been tested and built on Debian 5-6 and
SLES 11.

=== Usage

The easiest way to test and use Rudder is to install it from the provided Linux packages, 
see: http://www.rudder-project.org/foswiki/Main/Installation

You can also build these packages yourself. Each directory in this git
repository contains the packaging for one package, including the following

.directories
* BUILD - contains temporary files during RPM builds
* debian - is the main debian packaging directory as found in all debian packages
* RPMS - contains binary RPMs after they are built
* SOURCES - contains patches or original sources to package, and is used to
    download any other necessary sources
* SPECS - contains RPM spec files
* SRPMS - contains source RPMs after they are built

Before building any packages, make sure you download the required source files,
by entering the SOURCES directory and running make:

----
$ cd <package name>/SOURCES && make
----

IMPORTANT: GIT_BRANCH_RUDDER is not defined by default. You have to replace "<put branch or tag name here>" by a branch or a tag name.

.Branches
* branches/rudder/2.3 (maintained versions)
* origin/master (alpha version)
