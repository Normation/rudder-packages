# Java Garbage collector option
# On large heap (6 Go or more) and loaded platforms, ConcurrentMarkSweep (default GC 
# for Rudder) becomes inefficient and Rudder can experience long "stop the world" 
# garbage collections.
# To avoid that, you can use G1GC which leads to faster (or no) full GC on big heap,
# at the prize of a less throughout and a need of some more memory to work 
# efficiently (~10%).
# You can also tune you GC option here.
